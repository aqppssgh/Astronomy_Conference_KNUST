    "Python (programming language) Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. It is very beginner friendly and the syntax is extremely simple to read and follow through. As python is object-oriented, it has its own garbage collector whereas in C user has to manage memory on his own. Python can be integrated with other languages such as C, C++, and Java. This means that a programmer can take advantage of work already done in another language while using Python.\n",

This makes it particularly valuable for archiving and sharing astronomical data and images.\n",
